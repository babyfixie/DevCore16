          What programming languages are most often used in your project?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-item-text">
          In the field of web development, there are various technologies and

        <h3 class="faq-item-tittle">What are the deadlines for the project?</h3>
        <p class="faq-item-text">
          The terms of project implementation depend to a large extent on a
          number of factors, such as the scope of the project, its complexity,
          and the availability of resources. Determining exact deadlines is a
          difficult task, and it usually occurs during the planning phase of the
          project.
